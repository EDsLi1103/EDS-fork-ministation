  # Atmospherics
  Atmospherics is the engineering subdepartment responsible for maintaining the station's atmosphere, and ensuring that it is safe and breathable for the crew.

  Atmospherics is run by Atmospheric Technicians, who are overseen by the Chief Engineer.

  During standard operation, if a normal vent detects that the outside environment is space, it will automatically cease operation until a minimum pressure is reached to avoid destruction of useful gasses. This can be fixed by pressurizing the room up to that minimum pressure by refilling it with a gas canister (potentially multiple, if the room is of significant size).

  Should you encounter a situation where scrubbers aren't cleaning a room fast enough (and the "Siphon" functionality still cannot keep up), employ portable scrubbers by dragging them to the affected location and wrenching them down. They work much faster than typical scrubbers and can clean up a room quite quickly. Large spills may require you to employ multiple.

  # Gas mixes and Burn chambers
  In the event you finish all the tasks at hand, you can make some extra money by creating new chemical gasses.

  ##Tritium
  Tritium is a clear, green gas that is highly flammable, radioactive, and combusts when in contact with oxygen, making it very helpful when running the [color=#a4885c]TEG[/color].
  It can be made by burning 1% Plasma and 96% or more Oxygen in the Burn Chamber (Ideal ratio is 3% Plasma to 97% Oxygen). You can extract this gas through scrubbers.

  ##BZ
  BZ gas is a potent hallucinogenic, as well as a sleeping agent for slimes. It is toxic to breathe and causes respiratory irritation and coughing. BZ sees frequent use as an ingredient in more complex gas reactions.

  ##Frezon
  Frezon is a bluish-green gas that is very complex and very dangerous. To obtain frezon, you must mix Tritium, Oxygen, and Nitrogen in a 70K room to start the reaction, and prevent the Tritium from combusting with the oxygen.

  </Box>

  It is critical to understand that a frezon leak can devastate the station, causing a wintery hell filled with itchy sweaters and cold burns. Frezon is very cold, and can freeze the station to death if even a few moles get out, so make sure that you lock your canisters or just move your Frezon straight into a storage room.

  ##Healium
  Healium is a red gas which acts as a strong sleeping agent, while healing burns, bruises, and toxin damage. Excessive use will lead to inebriation.

  ##Nitrium
  Nitrium is a gaseous stimulant that when inhaled can enhance speed and endurance. At lower concentrations Nitrium will increase your top running speed while healthy and unimpaired. Additionally, at slightly higher concentrations, breathing Nitrium will prevent drowsiness. At high concentrations breathing it will begin to shut down a person's lungs, causing asphyxiation.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVentScrubber"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="StorageCanister" Caption="nitrium canister"/>
  </Box>

  Nitrium degrades into nitrogen and water vapor on contact with room temperature oxygen. This reaction can produce a good deal of heat, making the station uncomfortably warm in the event of a leak. 

  ## Reference Sheet
  - Standard atmospheric mix is [color=#a4885c]78% N2 and 22% O2 at 101.24kPa.[/color]
  - Gas obeys real math. You can use the equation:

  ## Responsibilities
  Generally, you'll be responding to [textlink="atmospheric upsets" link="AtmosphericUpsets"] throughout the station.
  These can range from minor leaks to full-on [textlink="fires" link="Fires"] or [textlink="spacing" link="Spacing"] incidents.

  People from other departments may also request [textlink="canned gasses" link="GasCanisters"] for their department duties, such as [textlink="plasma" link="Gasses"] for the [textlink="Research Department" link="Science"] or [textlink="carbon dioxide" link="Gasses"] for [textlink="Chemistry" link="Chemist"].

  In your downtime, you may seek to improve the station by setting up rooms with different atmospheres for [textlink="Voxes" link="Vox"] and other species, or by setting up production of [textlink="exotic gasses" link="Gasses"] for the station's needs.

  When there's no work to do, you may be expected to help regular Station Engineers with their tasks, and mentor new Station Engineers and Atmospheric Technicians.
